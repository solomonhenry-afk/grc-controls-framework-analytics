# Lighthouse Technology Governance Model

## Mission
To operationalize Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) practices across digital, cloud, and security infrastructures.

## Governance Pillars
1. **Policy Integration:** Frameworks unified via central repository.  
2. **Automation:** CI pipelines for risk prediction and compliance validation.  
3. **Transparency:** Reports and dashboards publicly verifiable.  
4. **Accountability:** Control owners mapped to framework domains.  

This model mirrors how a real enterprise GRC architecture can function end-to-end â€” from policy to analytics to executive reporting.
