# GDPR Principles Overview

The system integrates privacy controls by design.

## Implementation Highlights
- **Data Minimization:** Model excludes PII during training.  
- **Purpose Limitation:** Data used strictly for compliance/risk purposes.  
- **Integrity & Confidentiality:** Enforced via encrypted storage.  

Reports in `/reports/compliance_scorecards` show compliance drift over time with GDPR-aligned metrics.
