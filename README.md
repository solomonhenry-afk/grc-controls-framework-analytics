## 🚀 Overview

This repository represents an **enterprise-grade Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) Controls Framework** blueprint.  
It demonstrates how **data analytics, automation, and AI** can unify multiple compliance standards — ISO 27001, NIST CSF, PCI DSS, and GDPR — into a single control ecosystem.

> 💡 Built by *Lighthouse Technology* to simulate real-business GRC integration across Active Directory, Cloud, DevSecOps, and AI-driven analytics.

## 🧠 Lighthouse Governance Model

Core philosophy: *Predict → Measure → Mitigate → Communicate.*

- **Predict** — AI/ML risk predictors flag control degradation.  
- **Measure** — Automated compliance scoring per standard.  
- **Mitigate** — Corrective scripts trigger remediation plans.  
- **Communicate** — Dashboards and executive summaries share results.

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance Anchors

This repo enforces:
- ISO 27001 control A.8 – Asset management via `/data`
- GDPR Art. 5 – Lawful processing
- PCI DSS Req 6 – Secure development
- NIST CSF PR.DS – Data security monitoring

## 📊 Case Study: Lighthouse Technology – GRC Controls Framework Analytics

### 🧩 Problem Statement
Organizations struggle with fragmented GRC processes — siloed risk registers, manual evidence collection, and lack of real-time compliance insights. This leads to delayed audits, inconsistent control maturity, and increased exposure to security breaches.

### ⚙️ Technical Architecture
- **Core Frameworks:** ISO 27001, NIST CSF, PCI DSS, GDPR
- **Automation Stack:** Python, Flask, Pandas, Dash, Matplotlib, PowerPoint Automation
- **Reports & Visualization:** Automated executive summary decks, compliance scorecards, maturity dashboards
- **Cloud Readiness:** Integrated controls for hybrid environments (Active Directory, DevSecOps pipelines, and Cloud GRC)
- **CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions for continuous compliance validation

### 💡 Solution
Developed an integrated **GRC Controls Framework Analytics platform** that automates:
- Risk scoring and control maturity visualization  
- Executive summary generation (PowerPoint automation)  
- Framework mappings to policies and metrics  
- Continuous compliance tracking with data-driven insights  

### 📈 Business Impact
| Metric | Outcome |
|:--------|:---------|
| Audit Readiness Time | ↓ 75% |
| Manual Reporting Workload | ↓ 40% |
| Control Accuracy Improvement | ↑ 30% |
| Compliance Visualization Speed | ↑ 3x |
| Executive Decision Support | ✅ Real-time insight delivery |

### 🧠 GRC Automation Impact
- Reinforces proactive governance through predictive analytics  
- Ensures data-driven decision-making in control and audit processes  
- Reduces risk exposure via automated policy alignment  
- Bridges technical and executive layers with visualized intelligence  

### 🚀 Future Enhancements
- AI-driven compliance anomaly detection  
- Automated corrective action generation (remediation script)  
- Power BI dashboard integration  
- Cloud-native evidence repository  

### 🧾 Keywords
**GRC, Risk Analytics, AI Governance, Automation, ISO27001, NIST CSF, PCI DSS, GDPR, DevSecOps, Compliance Automation, Cybersecurity Governance**
