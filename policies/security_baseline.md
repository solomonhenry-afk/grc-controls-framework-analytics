# Security Baseline Policy

All servers, endpoints, and codebases within the GRC Controls Framework must comply with:

- MFA for admin access  
- TLS 1.2+ encryption  
- Automated dependency scanning (via GitHub Actions)  
- Weekly patch cadence  
- Centralized logging and alerting  

Any deviation triggers a “Non-Compliant” flag in compliance_scorecards.
