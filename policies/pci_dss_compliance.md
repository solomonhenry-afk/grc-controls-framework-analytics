# PCI DSS Compliance Overview

## Purpose
Outline how the analytics platform can extend to manage PCI DSS compliance for payment systems.

## Core PCI DSS Requirements (v4.0)
1. Install and maintain secure configurations.
2. Protect stored account data.
3. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data.
4. Maintain vulnerability management program.
5. Implement strong access control.
6. Monitor and test networks.
7. Maintain an information security policy.

## Application Integration
- Risk prediction model will support **control effectiveness scoring** for PCI DSS requirements 2â€“5.
- Dashboards highlight **non-compliant assets** and **cardholder data exposure risk**.

## Future Work
Integrate automated scans from **Qualys PCI ASV reports** and map remediation tasks directly to dashboard findings.
